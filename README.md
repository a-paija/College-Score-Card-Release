<h1>Data Exploration Project: College Scorecard & Google Trends</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This project investigates whether the release of the **College Scorecard** in September 2015 influenced student interest in high-earning colleges relative to low-earning ones. Google Trends data is used as a proxy for student search interest. The analysis uses a **Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach** to visualize this effect.

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Imported raw data and standardized Google Trends indices (`index_z`).  
   - Merged with Scorecard data using the mapping file.  
   - Filtered and aggregated data for analysis by date and earnings group.

2. **Difference-in-Differences Model**  
   ```r
   did_model <- feols(
     index_z ~ treatment_group * post_policy + i(month_num, ref = 1) | schname,
     data = clean_data
   )

 - Interaction coefficient: -0.061

 - Standard Error: 0.02

 - Analysis: High-earning schools experienced a relative decline of 0.061 standard deviations in search interest compared to low-earning schools after the Scorecard release (p â‰ˆ 0.0023).
 - Interpretation: After the release of the College Scorecard, student interest in high-earning colleges decreased slightly compared to low-earning colleges. This change is statistically significant, indicating that the Scorecard may have shifted attention away from higher-earning schools

3. Findings

![DiD Model](https://github.com/a-paija/College-Score-Card-Release/blob/main/DiD%20Model.png)

 - Pre-trends: Both groups show similar search interest before September 2015.

 - Post-release: Relative search interest in high-earning colleges decreased.

 - Possible explanations: increased awareness of selectivity/cost, revealed attractive features of lower-earning schools, or high-earning schools already well-known.
